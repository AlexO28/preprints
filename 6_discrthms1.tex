Let $I=\Zplus$ and the norms of all matrices $A_k$ and $\inv{A_k}$ be bounded by $M>0.$ A sequence $\Ac$ has property $B_\omega(I)$ iff it is hyperbolic on  $\Zplus.$

\begin{theoremnon} [a generalization of the discrete analog of Pliss Theorem] \label{thm:mainpliscor}
Let $I=\Zb$ and the norms of all matrices $A_k$ and $\inv{A_k}$ be bounded by $M>0.$ A sequence $\Ac$ has property $B_\omega(I)$ iff it is hyperbolic on both  $\Zplus$ and $\Zminus$ and the spaces $B^+(\Ac)$ and $B^-(\Ac)$ are transverse. Here
\begin{eqnarray*}
B^+(\Ac)=\setdef{v\in\Rb^d}{\vmod{\Phi_{k,0}v}\to 0,\ k\to +\infty}, \\
B^-(\Ac)=\setdef{v\in\Rb^d}{\vmod{\Phi_{k,0}v}\to 0,\ k\to -\infty}.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{theoremnon}

There are lots of papers concerning results of this type. They generalize theorems of Maizel and Pliss in different directions (Latushkin, Baskakov, Sasu). For infinite dimensional equations and/or different classes of spaces having certain homogeneity properties. Spaces $\Nc_\omega(I)$ are neither homogeneous in the sense of Baskakov nor translation-Invariant in the sense of Sasu.
