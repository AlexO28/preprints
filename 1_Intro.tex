The theory of shadowing of approximate trajectories (pseudotrajectories)
of dynamical systems is now a well-developed part of the global theory of
dynamical systems.
%(see, for example, the monographs \cite{PILSDS, PALSDS}).
This theory is closely related to the classical theory of structural stability.
