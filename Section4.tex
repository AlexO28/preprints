\section{Main results.}

The following theorem is the main result of our manuscript.

\begin{thm}\label{thmVirtNilp}
Let $\Phi$ be an uniformly continuous action of a finitely generated virtually nilpotent group $G$ on a metric space $\Omega$. Assume that there exists an element $g \in G$ such that $f_g$ is topologically Anosov with respect to a pair $(U, V)$.
Then the action $\Phi$ is topologically Anosov with respect to the pair~$(U, V)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{remark} This result generalizes \cite{PilTikh}, where a similar statement was proved for abelian $G$.
\end{remark}

The main step of the proof is the following lemma, which is interesting by itself:
\begin{lem}\label{lemNormSubgroup}
Let $G$ be a finitely generated group and $H$ be its finitely generated normal subgroup. Let $\Phi$ be an uniformly continuous action on $\Omega$. If $\Phi|_H$ is topologically Anosov with respect to a pair $(U, V)$, then $\Phi$ is topologically Anosov with respect to the pair $(U, V)$ too.
\end{lem}

It turns out that Theorem \ref{thmVirtNilp} cannot be generalized to the case of solvable groups. Consider a solvable group $G = BS(1, n) = \; <a, b| ba = a^nb>$, where $n > 1$. For $\lam >0$ consider the action $\Phi: G \times \RR \to \RR$ generated by the maps
$$
f_a(x) = x, \quad f_b(x) = \lam x.
$$
Note that $f_b \circ f_a = f_a^n \circ f_b$ and hence the action of $G$ is well defined.


\begin{thm}
\label{ThBS}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(i)] For $\lambda \in (1, n]$ the action $\Phi$ does not have the shadowing property.
  \item[(ii)] For $\lambda > n$ the action $\Phi$ has the shadowing property.
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

For actions of free groups we prove the following theorem:

\begin{thm}
\label{thIMElin}
Any linear action of a
finitely generated free group with at least two generators
does not have the shadowing property.
\end{thm}

This theorem leads us to the following conjecture and question.

\begin{conj}
Any uniformly continuous action of a finitely generated free group with at least two generators on a manifold does not have the shadowing property.
\end{conj}
\begin{question}
Which groups admit an action on a manifold satisfying the shadowing property?
\end{question}

We derive Theorem \ref{thIMElin} from the following more general, but more technical statement:

\begin{thm}
\label{thIME}
Let $G$ be a finitely generated free group with at least two generators. Let $\Phi$ be an uniformly continuous action of $G$ on a metric space~$\Omega$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If for some $g\in G$ the map $f_{g}$ is expansive, then $\Phi$ does not have shadowing.
  \item If for some $g\in G$, $g \ne e$, the map $f_{g}$ does not have shadowing, then $\Phi$ does not have shadowing too.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{remark}
\label{remIME}
Item 1 of Theorem \ref{thIME} holds for a more general class of groups with infinitely many ends (we refer the reader to \cite{BrHaef} for the precise definition).
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thIMElin}.]
Since for linear actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ both shadowing and expansivity are equivalent to hyperbolicity, Theorem \ref{thIMElin} follows from Theorem~\ref{thIME}.
\end{proof}
